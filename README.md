## Downloading & Installing

1. Create a new folder (for example `mkdir -p /home/username/FXServer/server`), this will be used for the server binaries.
2. Download the current recommended `master` branch build for Linux from the [artifacts server](https://runtime.fivem.net/artifacts/fivem/build_proot_linux/master/) (copy the URL for the latest server version and use `wget <url>` to download it).
3. Extract the build to the directory that was previously created, using `cd /home/username/FXServer/server && tar xf fx.tar.xz` (you need to have `xz` installed, on Debian/Ubuntu this is in the `xz-utils` package).
