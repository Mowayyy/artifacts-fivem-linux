1. Create a new folder (for example mkdir -p /home/username/FXServer/server), this will be used for the server binaries.
2. Download the current recommended master branch build for Linux from the [artifacts server](https://runtime.fivem.net/artifacts/fivem/build_proot_linux/master/) (copy the URL for the latest server version and use wget <url> to download it).
